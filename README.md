# fastlane_demo

A demo app showing how to use [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) to release and
patch iOS apps using the
[fastlane-plugin-shorebird](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-shorebird/)
fastlane plugin.

This app's setup largely follows [this
guide](https://medium.com/revelo-tech/setting-up-automatic-ios-release-with-fastlane-and-match-on-ci-cd-server-16c3f1d79bc5),
with Shorebird-specific steps added after completing the steps in the guide.

All fastlane files are located in [`ios/fastlane`](./ios/fastlane/).

A step-by-step log of me (bryanoltman) creating this demo is viewable in
[setup_log.md](./setup_log.md).
